- A covariance function
-- Is a kernel
-- The gram matrix will be a covariance matrix
-- A kernel may not be a covariance function if it isn't PSD

- Squared exponential CF
-- infinitely differentiable -> very smooth. But 'real' processes may not have this property
-- can also be obtained by a RBF feature space

- Anisotropic stationary CF's can be created with the distance function
  r^2 = (x-x')^T M (x-x')
  --- where M is some PSD matrix

- Neural Networks for Gaussian Processes
-- TODO: Refer Slides/Book
-- Question: Why does the NN CF have jumps and non-smooth sections (In the gene experssion graph)
-- Tanh non-linearity doesn't produce valid NN CF's.
